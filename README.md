Sudoku Solvers
--------------

"Why have you wrote so many Sudoku solvers?" - "For fun, and to compare new programming languages as they gain prominence."

Most use a fairly similar design, but I have tried to be true to the language. I have removed some because I couldn't get through them without saying, "Wow, I don't like this language."

Here they are:
