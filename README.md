Coding is mostly for fun.

Public Repositories
-------------------

- [maxtremaine.github.io](https://github.com/maxtremaine/maxtremaine.github.io): My personal website. Not as exciting as me IRL.
- [REPEATRANGE](https://github.com/maxtremaine/REPEATRANGE): Custom formula for Google Sheets. Repeats a range.
- [SVG Clock](https://github.com/maxtremaine/svg-clock): I like clocks, so I made one in SVG. It ticks.

Sudoku Solvers
--------------

"Why have you wrote so many Sudoku solvers?" - "For fun, and to compare new programming languages as they gain prominence."

Most use a fairly similar design, but I have tried to be true to the language. I have removed some because I couldn't get through them without saying, "Wow, I don't like this language."

Here they are:
